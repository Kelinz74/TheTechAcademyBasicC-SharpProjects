- Inputs include their; name, the course they are on, page number and more.

### [Console Application Assignment for doing math in C#](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/ConsoleApplicationAssignment)
- Takes an input from the user, multiplies it by 50, then prints the result to the console.
- Takes an input from the user, adds 25 to it, then prints the result to the console.
- Takes an input from the user, divides it by 12.5, then prints the result to the console.
- Takes an input from the user, checks if it is greater than 50, then prints the true/false result to the console.
- Takes an input from the user, divides it by 7, then prints the remainder to the console.

### [Math and Comparison Operator Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/MathAndComparisonOperatorSubmissionAssignment)
- Take the input of Person 1 for their Hourly Rate and hours worked.
- Take the same information from Person Two.
- Display the Annual Salary of Person 1 and Person 2.
- Compare if Person 1 makes more than Person 2. 

### [Boolean Logic Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/BooleanLogicSubmissionAssignment/BooleanLogicSubmissionAssignment)
- An application setting up a basic approval program for car insurance.
- It will ask the applicant some questions and return a "true" or "false" at the end to determine whether or not the applicant qualified for car insurance.

### [Branching Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/BranchingSubmissionAssignment/BranchingSubmissionAssignment)
- A program to create a console-based application for getting a shipping quote for a package.
- The first line of the program gives a welcome message.
- The user is then prompted for an input of the weight of the package.
- With an if statement if the input for the weight is greater then 50, an error message will display and the program will end.
- If package is under 50 the user is prompted for inputs of height, lenght, and width.  
- If the total dimensions is greater than 50 an error message will display.  
- If under 50 the results will be calculated using weight * width * height * length / 100.  
- The result of that calculation is the quote displayed to the user as a dollar amount with an itemized lise of the inputs.

### [Do/While Statement Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/BooleanDoWhileConsoleApp/ConsoleAppSubmissionAssignment)
- Created a console app that includes a Do/While Statement with a Switch statement for options. 
- Options are to choose a number of 1 - 5 with and a final default which will take you back to choosing from 1 - 5 with a while loop. 
- The Boolean variable starts as false.  Until it is changed to true by choosing a number 1-5. 
- Each number 1 - 5 has its own unique statement that will be printed to the console. 
- If 6 or greater is chosen, the default will present the question again of choosing 1 - 5 until 1 - 5 is chosen. 

### [String Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/StringAssignment/StringAssignment)
- A string assignment demonstrating string Concatenation. 
- Using the .ToUpper method. 
- Using the StringBuilder Class to be able to make changes to a string. 
- In C# string values in themselves are not mutable and take up memory if not in a StringBuilder object.

### [Console App Array Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/ConsoleAppArraySubmissionAssignment/ConsoleAppArraySubmissionAssignment)
- Created a one-dimensional Array of strings with a question that would ask the user to input a int value of 1 through 4 to represent the value of the index for the array.  
- It would print the value for the index of the array.  
- Also created a one-dimensional array of integers.  
- Asking the user again to input a int value representing the value of the index which would then print the value of that index to the console.  
- Created a list of strings.  
- An input from the user representing the index of the list will print to the console the value of that index in the list.

### [Console App Six Part Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/SixPartAssignmentListsandArrays/ConsoleAppSixPartAssignment)

**Part 1.** 
- Set up a one-dimensional array of strings with a question for user input. 
- Created a loop that iterates through each string in the array and adds the user's text input to the end of each string.  
- Created a loop that prints off each string in the array on a serparate line.  

**Part 2.** 
- Created an infinite loop demonstration.  
- Provided the proper codeing to fix the infinit loop so that it will execute properly.  

**Part 3.**  
- Created a loop where the comparison that's used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a **"<"** operator.  
- Created a loop where the comparison that's used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a **"<="** operator.  

**Part 4.**  
- Created a list of strings where each item in the list is unique.  
- Asked the user to input text to search for in the list.  
- Created a loop that iterates through the list and then displays the index of the list that contains matching text on the screen.  
- Added code to the loop to check if the suer put in text that isn't on the list and, if they did, tells the user their input is not on the list.  
- Once a match has been found the loop will stop.  

**Part 5.**   
- Created a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.  
- Asked the user to input text to search for in the list.  
- Created a loop that iterates through the list and then displays the idices of the items matching the user input.  
- Added code to the loop to check if the user put in text that isn't on the list and, if they did, tells the user their input is not on the list.  

**Part 6.** 
- created a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.  
- Created a foreach loop that evaluates each item in the list, and displays a message showing the string and whether or not it has already appeared in the list.

### [Console App Strings and Integers Submission Assignment(try/catch)](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/ConsoleAppStringsAndIntegersSubmissionAssignment)
- Created a list of integers. 
- Asked the user for a input to divide each number in the list by.  
- Created a loop that takes each interger in the list, divides it by the number the user entered, and displays the result to the screen.  
- Tested for 0 division error and if the input was a string error.  
- Then set up a try/catch statement to catch these errors. 
-  Looped back around with a while loop to ask again for an input that can be used in the division code.
