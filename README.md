### [Branching Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/BranchingSubmissionAssignment/BranchingSubmissionAssignment)
- A program to create a console-based application for getting a shipping quote for a package.
- The first line of the program gives a welcome message.
- The user is then prompted for an input of the weight of the package.
- With an if statement if the input for the weight is greater then 50, an error message will display and the program will end.
- If package is under 50 the user is prompted for inputs of height, lenght, and width.

- It would print the value for the index of the array.  
- Also created a one-dimensional array of integers.  
- Asking the user again to input a int value representing the value of the index which would then print the value of that index to the console.  
- Created a list of strings.  
- An input from the user representing the index of the list will print to the console the value of that index in the list.

### [Console App Six Part Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/SixPartAssignmentListsandArrays/ConsoleAppSixPartAssignment)

**Part 1.** 
- Set up a one-dimensional array of strings with a question for user input. 
- Created a loop that iterates through each string in the array and adds the user's text input to the end of each string.  
- Created a loop that prints off each string in the array on a serparate line.  

**Part 2.** 
- Created an infinite loop demonstration.  
- Provided the proper codeing to fix the infinit loop so that it will execute properly.  

**Part 3.**  
- Created a loop where the comparison that's used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a **"<"** operator.  
- Created a loop where the comparison that's used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a **"<="** operator.  

**Part 4.**  
- Created a list of strings where each item in the list is unique.  
- Asked the user to input text to search for in the list.  
- Created a loop that iterates through the list and then displays the index of the list that contains matching text on the screen.  
- Added code to the loop to check if the suer put in text that isn't on the list and, if they did, tells the user their input is not on the list.  
- Once a match has been found the loop will stop.  

**Part 5.**   
- Created a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.  
- Asked the user to input text to search for in the list.  
- Created a loop that iterates through the list and then displays the idices of the items matching the user input.  
- Added code to the loop to check if the user put in text that isn't on the list and, if they did, tells the user their input is not on the list.  

**Part 6.** 
- created a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.  
- Created a foreach loop that evaluates each item in the list, and displays a message showing the string and whether or not it has already appeared in the list.

### [Console App Strings and Integers Submission Assignment(try/catch)](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/ConsoleAppStringsAndIntegersSubmissionAssignment)
- Created a list of integers. 
- Asked the user for a input to divide each number in the list by.  
- Created a loop that takes each interger in the list, divides it by the number the user entered, and displays the result to the screen.  
- Tested for 0 division error and if the input was a string error.  
- Then set up a try/catch statement to catch these errors. 
-  Looped back around with a while loop to ask again for an input that can be used in the division code.

### [Calling Methods Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/CallingMethodsSubmissionAssignment)
- Created a class, in that class created three methods, each of which will take one integer parameter in and return an integer.  
- The methods do some math operations on the received parameter.  
- The class is in a separate .cs file in the application.  
- In the main() program, there is a WriteLine method statement asking the user for a number they want to do the math operations on.  
- Made calles from the Main() program for each method in turn, passing the user input to the methods.  
- Displaying all results from the methods to the consol.

- Created a math operation for the integer  then returned the answer as an integer.  
- Created two more methods of the same name utilizing method overflow with different values passed into each.  
- The second method is a decimal value and the third method a string.  
- The string value was converted to an integer for a multiplication calcution.  
- The result was return as an integer value.

- WIth requests in the console, asked the user to iinput two numbers one at a time.  
- The second input could be left black if the user didn't want to input a second number.  
- Made the call to the method in the class, passing in the one or two numbers entered.  
- If the second number was black, it was automaticaly supplied with a 0 as the value as stated from above.

### [Method Class Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/MethodClassSubmissionAssignment)
- Created a class.  
- In that class, created a void method that takes two integers as parameters with the method performing a math calculation on the first integer and displying the second integer to the screen.

- Called the method in the class passing in tow numbers.  
- Called the method in the class specifying the parameters by name.

### [Class Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Kelinz74/TheTechAcademyBasicC-SharpProjects/tree/main/ClassSubmissionAssignment)
